# SCU - Introduction to Web and Programming Environments

### Sessions 0-4

Hi all, and welcome to the course. Before we dive into the world of web and programming, let's dip our toes into a [graphic-based introduction](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) to some programming fundamentals.

For a good general purpose introduction to JavaScript, who better than Mozilla? [Bookmark this resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) for concepts and practice that we will use throughout this course

Next, we'll hop over [here for sessions 1-3](https://github.com/J-Fo-S/no-business-business-cards) to learn to code in JavaScript and p5.js. We'll put these new concepts and skills towards our first project: designing our very own generative business cards.
