# SCU - Introduction to Web and Programming Environments

### Sessions 0

Hi all, and welcome to the course. Before we dive into the world of web and programming, let's dip our toes into a [graphic-based introduction](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) to some programming fundamentals.

### Resources and Tutorials

For a good general purpose introduction to JavaScript, who better than Mozilla? [Bookmark this resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) for concepts and practice that we will use throughout this course.

However, even beginner Mozilla tutorials can be sometimes wordy and technical. For a very user-friendly site that explains all things web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) AND let's you test code in the browser, you can use [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/). Between these two, you have exponential lifetimes worth of knowledge base.

Yet, when you have a specific bug or problem not addressed in generalized tutorials, your best bet is [Stack Overflow]https://stackoverflow.com/). Just search Google with your specific code issue and this site is likely to come up with an answer (or 20).

### Sessions 1-3

Now we really begin. Hop over [here for sessions 1-3](https://github.com/J-Fo-S/no-business-business-cards) to learn to code in JavaScript and p5.js. We'll put these new concepts and skills towards our first project: designing our very own generative business cards.
